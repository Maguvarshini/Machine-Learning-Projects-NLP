# üß† Machine Learning Projects - NLP

This repository contains my collection of **Machine Learning projects focused on Natural Language Processing (NLP)**.  
Each project demonstrates different techniques in **text preprocessing, feature extraction, model building, and evaluation**.  

The goal is to build a portfolio of NLP projects step by step ‚Äî starting from basic ML models to advanced deep learning and transformer-based approaches.

## Projects

### 1> Resume Screening with Python
- **Overview:** Classifies resumes into different job categories using NLP + Machine Learning.
- **Tech Stack:** Python, Pandas, NLTK, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib.
- **Features:**
  - Text preprocessing (cleaning, stopword removal, regex)
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations
  - Machine Learning model training (KNN with One-vs-Rest)
  - Classification report & accuracy evaluation
- **Results:** Achieved ~99% accuracy on the dataset.
